# Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection system using machine learning to identify and prevent fraudulent financial transactions, enhancing security and reducing financial losses.

## Objective
The goal is to:
- Develop a machine learning model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.
- Implement techniques to handle imbalanced data effectively.

## Approach

### Data Processing and Analysis
- **Data Collection**: Gathered transaction data from financial records.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed and cleaned data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to identify patterns, trends, and hidden relationships in the data using visualization techniques.

### Handling Imbalanced Data
- Managed highly imbalanced data (only 0.13% fraudulent transactions) using advanced techniques such as:
  - Ensemble models
  - Over-sampling (e.g., SMOTE)
  - Under-sampling (e.g., RandomUnderSampler)

### Model Development and Evaluation
- Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models to classify fraudulent transactions, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation & Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
